# Simple Geometry Application

## Project Description
This Java application models geometric shapes using abstract classes and inheritance. It demonstrates calculating area and perimeter for Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle using appropriate formulas.

### Features
- Abstract class `Shape` with concrete and abstract methods.
- Subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` implementing abstract methods.
- Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction principles.
